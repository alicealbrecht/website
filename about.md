# About

# Hi, I'm Alice.

I'm interested in the way humans work, where their limits are, and how we can use the data they produce to build products and tools that can enable them to overcome those limits. 

I do this in a few ways and always through the lens of understanding what the social and ethical implications are for I'm building or advising others how to build.

I've had a few careers now, including as a cognitive neuroscientist and as a data science and machine learning specialist. I'm currently actively consulting and advising companies[hyperlink to contact] and working on building out a few of my own ideas. 

## Data Strategy

I've led machine learning strategy and advising for Cloudera's Fast Forward Labs, led data science for Simple Finance, and have worked to build data products at Yahoo! and JP Morgan.

I really enjoy working with clients to uncover how they can capitalize on their current investment in data or place smart bets with data investments moving forward. It all starts with understanding what's possible using data and machine learning and then crafting a plan that allows projects to build on one another. You can learn more [here](hyperlink to data strategy page) about what I'm up to in this space.  

## Building tools to make humans better

I've been a part of building some really amazing products and seen first hand how much of an impact something can have on people's daily lives. I've also seen how some of the technology we've built isn't quite meeting our vision for a utopia of augmented humans. I'm combining my experience in neuroscience, machine learning and product development to create tools that are aimed at helping humans have better interactions in a world they didn't evolve for. I'll be writing about my thoughts and mad experiments [here](link to projects page) as they evolve so stay tuned for what's to come.

## Speaking

I have been speaking publicly on data, hiring (using science!), machine learning and what it all means for businesses of any size for several years. Most of my talks aren't recorded, but you can hear me on the [Develomentor podast] ([https://develomentor.com/2020/02/03/alice-albrecht/](https://develomentor.com/2020/02/03/alice-albrecht/)). I also provide leadership education talks for companies to help them understand what's possible for them with data and machine learning. [Reach out](link to contact page) if you'd like to have me speak. 

## Advising and mentoring

I'm a big believer that the best way to make an impact on the world is by holding others up. I spend a portion of my time advising and mentoring both formally and informally on a variety of topics. Feel free to [reach out](link to contact page) if you're interested.
