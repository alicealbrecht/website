I'm a seasoned data professional with experience building products, leading teams, and advising Fortune 500 companies how to grow their data and machine learning (AI) capabilities. I'm driven by an intense interest in how humans work and how we can enable them.

I hold a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from Yale and have worked in several different capacities building and scaling data products.

All of my work is done through the lens of understanding what the social and ethical implications are for what I'm building or advising others how to build.

I'm actively consulting and advising companies while working on building out my own ideas.
