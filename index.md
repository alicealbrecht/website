I'm interested in the way humans work, where their limits are, and how we can use the data they produce to build products and tools that can enable them. 

I do this in a few ways and always through the lens of understanding what the social and ethical implications are for what I'm building or advising others how to build.

I hold a PhD in cognitive neuroscience from Yale and have spent many years in data science and machine learning/AI as a practitioner, leader, researcher and consultant. 

I'm actively consulting and advising companies and working on building out a few of my own ideas.
