## I help companies build the future
I consult with companies big and small to plan for how data and machine learning/AI will shape their business. The world is changing evermore rapidly and I firmly believe that done correctly, integrating data and machine learning/AI opens up opportunities that were inconceivable a decade ago. I’ve spent years advising companies of all sizes and focus in particular on helping my clients realize a return on the investments they’ve already made in data by thoughtfully planning work that builds on itself and enables future lines of business. 

## Strategy engagements (borrow a chief data officer)
Every company is unique, and so is what they’ve done with data to date. In these engagements I typically spend a few days onsite to learn more about what’s happening today and then deliver detailed recommendations. Instead of relying on the latest “best practices” I tailor all of my work to meet clients where they are at. That includes understanding how the lastest machine learning/AI advancements can be leveraged in their current situation and what talent, technology and organizational changes are needed to achieve that. 

##Education and advising
I enjoy helping clients understand what’s possible and inspire them to embrace the future through my leadership education speaking engagements. I also advise companies on an ongoing basis.
