# Hi, I'm Alice.

I'm interested in the way humans work, where their limits are, and how we can use the data they produce to build products and tools that can enable them to overcome those limits. 

I do this in a few ways and always through the lens of understanding what the social and ethical implications are for I'm building or advising others how to build.

I've had a few careers now, including as a cognitive neuroscientist and as a data science and machine learning specialist. I'm currently actively consulting and advising companies[hyperlink to contact] and working on building out a few of my own ideas.
