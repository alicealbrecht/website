## What's on my mind these days

When I'm not working with clients I'm spending my time working on projects to augment humans. At the moment I'm working on: 
 - Building a brain computer interface help people take back their control over everyday cognitive processes (like attention) 
 - Creating tools to enable individuals to thrive as the future of work becomes the work of today
 - Experimenting with ways to allow others to take on each other's mental state.
